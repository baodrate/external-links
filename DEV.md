# DEV NOTES

There are 3 types of links to be considered:

1. MD Links
2. HTML Links
3. Orphaned links (plain text URLs)
4. Relative links to other vault files

I'll only focus on 1 and 3 for now. Because those are the ones that can be turned into Obsidian Links.

ELH lets you configure which types of links to index in settings. I might do this later.

## TODO

1. List external links on side panel
2. Show external links count on editor status bar
3. Show backlinks for a given external link?
4. Command to replace external link with Obsidian Link
5. (If 4) Ability to let users customize the template for the generated Obsidian Link
6. Check that the CSS classes are still working even when the outgoing links plugin gets disabled
7. Change side panel icon
8. Make sure things disappear if the active file is closed
